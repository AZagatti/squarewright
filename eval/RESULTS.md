# Setup-development results

> **⚠️ Correction (2026-07-06, later): the numbers below were measured on a BROKEN harness and an inflating
> metric — treat them as superseded.** A four-angle investigation found: (1) a **silent tool-drop bug** — the
> worker returned empty findings (scored as "clean") when the model reasoned but never called the tool, worse
> at higher reasoning effort; (2) **file-level scoring over-credits** — a finding on the right *file* counted as
> a hit even if it described a different bug. Both are now fixed: the worker is **two-pass** (reason → structure)
> so it can't silently drop, and a **defect-match judge** (`scripts/judge.ts`) scores real root-cause matches.
> On the same personas-off run, the judge corrected **file-recall 5/12 → defect-recall 3/12** (~25%, in line
> with trimwire's ~27% reality). Also: Pi's reported cost badly undercounts reasoning tokens — real spend is now
> read from OpenRouter's credits balance. Re-runs on the fixed harness are the real numbers; the table below is

Measurements from tuning the review *setup* against the golden corpus (not a model ranking — that comes once
the setup is locked). All runs: `glm-5.2` via z.ai, grounded (repo read at PR revision). Scoring is loci-level
(a finding on an expected-locus file counts as a hit) — deliberately simple; a judge pass is a later refinement.

## Setup progression (18 clean+has-issue; recall over 12 has-issue loci)

| Config | Locus recall | Clean false-positives | Relative speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generic persona, thinking off | 3/12 | 2 | 1× |
| Generic persona, thinking high | 4/12 | — | ~10× |
| **Persona set, thinking off** | **5/12** | 2 | 1× |
| Persona set + as-designed thinking | 5/12 | — | ~2.5× |

## Findings

1. **Personas are the lever, not thinking.** The persona set (2 always-on batched: sentinel/correctness +
   warden/security; 4 glob-triggered solos: chromatic/CSS, foreman/build-config, stevedore/Docker, marshal/CI)
   lifted recall 3/12 → 5/12 with **no extra false positives and no speed cost**. It recovered tokio (1/2→2/2,
   lock-ordering) and grafana (0/1→1/1, Docker build-stage ownership) — exactly the personas' design targets.
2. **Thinking is not worth it here.** thinking-high on the generic persona reached only 4/12 at ~10× latency;
   personas + thinking merely *shuffled* which cases hit (gained tailwind/go-cli, lost tokio/moby) at ~2.5×
   latency — variance, not a reliable gain.
3. **The stubborn misses are model-bound.** vite (`fs.cpSync` Windows/​symlink defaults), rails (schema-cache
   sort → query order change), and swup (tsconfig change → dropped published `.d.ts`) are missed under *every*
   config even when a persona cues them — pointing at glm-5.2's reasoning ceiling, not the setup.

## Operating point

**Persona set, thinking off, grounded** — 5/12 loci (~42%) / 5-of-9 has-issue cases with ≥1 hit (~56%), 2
clean false-positives, fast. For context, trimwire's 67-case bench put real ambiguous-PR recall at ~27%.

## Next

- Add the adversarial **verifier** pass to clear the 2 clean-case false positives (precision).
- The remaining gap looks model-capability-bound → the setup is near "good enough to rank": run the
  cheap-vs-expensive-5-family model comparison on this locked persona+grounding setup.
